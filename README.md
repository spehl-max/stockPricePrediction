In this project, we,

1. Scrape news article headlines relevant to a financial current event,
2. Call an LLM to summarize the current event, and
3. Use an LLM to generate a stock price prediction.

The LLM's prediction for this particular example is very innacurate. 

I believe, with further tuning, and data pre-processing, LLM's have the potential to generate more acurate stock price predictions.
